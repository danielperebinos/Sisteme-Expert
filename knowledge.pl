%% dog diseases
disease(dog, 'Arthritis', 'Canine arthritis` is the pathological condition of a puppy s joints. Most of the time, arthritis affects old dogs.').
disease(dog, 'Aspergillosis', 'Canine aspergillosis is caused by a fungus called Aspergillus, which is most commonly found in decaying plant material, dry leaves and compost piles. It generally manifests itself in quadrupeds that have a long, male nose. The dog affected by Aspergillosis shows symptoms such as nasal discharge and bleeding, sneezing and, in some cases, depigmentation of the surface of the nose.').
disease(dog, 'Cardiac arrhythmia', 'Cardiac arrhythmia is a disturbance in the electrical activity of the puppy s heart. In other words, arrhythmia can cause either a faster or slower heart rate. This dysfunction can cause reduced blood flow, changes in blood pressure, heart failure and even fainting.').
disease(dog, 'Dental abscess', 'Dental abscess occurs in dogs when the four-legged dog s teeth are not taken care of and can be quite worrying, in serious cases. The abscess manifests itself in the form of a purulent infection at the level of the root of the tooth, observable at the level of the gum. In the case of molars, however, the abscess manifests itself much more seriously, reaching the production of fistulas (the purulent infection reaches the surface of the skin), due to the very long roots of these types of teeth.').
disease(dog, 'Periodontal', 'Periodontitis in dogs manifests itself through halitosis, red and inflamed gums, wounds on the surface of the face, mandible or mouth, visible tartar deposits. Also, the loss of appetite and the loss of food from the mouth are symptoms that indicate the manifestation of periodontal disease in the puppy. If it is not treated in time, periodontitis can cause damage to bone tissue, gums and, in serious cases, the infection can affect the internal organs of the quadruped.').
disease(dog, 'Babesiosis', 'Babesiosis is a serious infection caused by a parasite of the genus Babesia. It is transmitted through a tick or infected blood transfusions. Babesiosis is a deadly disease in dogs, if it is not treated quickly, causing severe anemia, by destroying the red blood cells in the dog s blood.').
disease(dog, 'Botulism', 'Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning, caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostidrium Botulinica. The toxin affects the peripheral nervous system, preventing the transmission of impulses from the nerve endings to the muscles. Thus, flaccid paralysis occurs (the muscles of the limbs no longer contract, and the puppy can no longer stand).').
disease(dog, 'Borreliosis', 'Lyme disease is a parasitic disease, one of the most dangerous diseases in dogs, often fatal. It is caused by Borrelia Burgdorferi, a bacterium from the category of spirochetes. Borreliosis, as Lyme disease is also known, is transmitted through a tick bite and is manifested by the destruction of red blood cells, causing hemolytic anemia.').
disease(dog, 'Blastomicoza', 'Blastomycosis in dogs is a disease caused by the fungus Blastomyces Dermatidis. The spores of this fungus enter the puppy s lungs through the airways, initially causing a lung infection. Later, untreated, the infection can spread throughout the quadruped''s body.').
disease(dog, 'Addison s disease', 'Addison s disease is also known as Hypoadrenocorticism and is a deficiency of the adrenal gland, which produces corticosteroid hormones. Poodles, Portuguese Water Dogs, Collies and Nova Scotia Duck-Tolling Retrievers are among the most affected by this disease.').
disease(dog, 'Cushing s syndrome', 'Cushing s syndrome is also known as Hyperadrenocorticism and involves an excessive secretion of cortisol. The factors that determine the adrenal gland disorder, in this case, can be: of endocrine origin: thyroid (excessive medication, iodine salts, inflammation, etc.) or pituitary; of nervous origin: serious nervous excitements, tumor formations, encephalitis, etc.').
disease(dog, 'Canine coronavirus', 'Canine coronavirus is a highly contagious intestinal disease. It is transmitted through contact with infected feces and spreads from dog to dog, when they sniff or when they play together. The disease is caused by the Coronavirus, a virus specific to all dogs, both domestic and wild.').
disease(dog, 'Dilated cardiomyopathy', 'Dilated cardiomyopathy is one of the most common heart diseases in dogs, especially in large dogs. The condition manifests itself, mainly, by the dilation and alteration of the left ventricular function of the heart, or of both ventricles.').
disease(dog, 'Tracheal collapse', 'Tracheal collapse is a condition that manifests itself through a dry and accelerated cough, agitation and permanent thirst. Tracheal collapse in dogs occurs as a result of the weakening of the tracheal cartilage.').
disease(dog, 'Colitis', 'Colitis is the inflammation of the colon. It can be caused by bacteria, parasites or even stress. Inflammation of the colon is characterized by the presence of a specific mucous membrane or blood at the level of the anus. In serious cases, dogs may vomit or have an abnormal defecation process: constipation or diarrhea.').
disease(dog, 'Cystitis', 'Cystitis is a serious disease in dogs, specific especially to females, which affects the urinary bladder, urethra and kidneys. Often, this condition is caused by the activity of pathogenic microorganisms. They are permanently present in the urethra, but are normally washed out by urine. However, when the dog is forced to suppress the need to urinate, suffers from hypothermia or is stressed, these microorganisms multiply rapidly and enter the bladder.').
disease(dog, 'Constipation', 'Dogs suffering from constipation are unable to defecate normally and regularly. For dogs, defecation takes place, normally, 2 times a day. When constipation sets in, however, the puppy can no longer defecate at all, has great difficulties in this process or produces very hard feces.').
disease(dog, 'Cancer', 'Even if there are tens, maybe hundreds of dog diseases, cancer remains the first cause of mortality in dogs aged +10 years. The main symptoms of the presence of cancer in dogs are either a lump or a lump, or a wound that does not heal, any type of swelling, swelling of a bone, abnormal bleeding, etc.').
disease(dog, 'Hip dysplasia', 'Hip dysplasia is one of the most common orthopedic problems in dogs. This condition manifests itself mainly in the case of large dog breeds. When we say hip dysplasia in dogs, we mean a hip condition, in which the end of the femur no longer joins correctly in its cavity. This phenomenon causes the joint to develop abnormally.').
disease(dog, 'Canine demodectic mange', 'Canine demodectic is a parasitic skin disease caused by Demodex Canis. The condition is infectious, but it is slightly contagious. Parasites develop uncontrollably on hair roots and sebaceous glands, developing two forms of disease manifestation: a dry form: reddish areas, fine scales, excess of oily secretions, unpleasant odor, scaling; a wet form: swollen and painful skin, stools with pus, lesions, unpleasant smell.').
disease(dog, 'Canine atopic dermatitis', 'Canine atopic dermatitis is a skin condition common to pets. About 10% of dogs are affected. The disease manifests itself as an inherited predisposition to develop allergies, as a result of repeated exposure to an allergen.').
disease(dog, 'Pyotraumatic dermatitis', 'Pyotraumatic dermatitis is mainly found in dogs with long hair and thick fur, being one of those dog diseases with an acute evolution. The first symptoms of pyotraumatic dermatitis are not visible. They appear for the first time in the form of primary lesions. These are self-inflicted by the dog, through persistent licking, scratching and repeated biting of painful or pruritic skin regions. Later, the wounds appear, on top of which the bacterial infection is superimposed.').
disease(dog, 'Flea allergic dermatitis', 'Allergic flea dermatitis is one of the most common allergies in dogs. This is caused by flea bites and, in particular, by their saliva. The condition causes intense itching and predisposition to the development of skin infections.').
disease(dog, 'Dirofilarioza cardiopulmonara', 'Dirofilariasis affects dogs through the presence of the worm species Dirofilaria Immitis in the right heart and pulmonary artery of the quadruped. The dog is infected by the bite of the carrier mosquitoes. The symptoms of this condition are manifested by heart failure, nervous disorders and skin problems.').
disease(dog, 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Diabetes is a chronic disease that can affect not only humans, but also dogs. This condition cannot be cured, but there are many methods by which it can be kept under control. Diabetes mellitus is the most common form of diabetes in dogs. It manifests itself through an imbalance in the way the puppy s body converts food consumed into energy.').
disease(dog, 'Cognitive dysfunction', 'Cognitive dysfunction in dogs is similar to Alzheimer s disease in humans. In dogs, cognitive dysfunction manifests itself through a series of changes in the brain. These lead to a decrease in the mental skills associated with the processes of thinking, recognition, memory, but also in acquired behavioral skills.').
disease(dog, 'Gastric dilatation and torsion', 'Gastric dilatation and torsion are two complementary diseases in dogs. Dilation happens when the dog s stomach fills with gas, food or fluids, increasing in size. Once dilated, the dog s stomach tends to rotate around its axis, thus causing gastric torsion.').
disease(dog, 'Epilepsia', 'Canine epilepsy is manifested by an increased predisposition of the quadruped to develop epileptic convulsive attacks. They are caused by the alteration of the balance between the excitatory activity and the cerebral inhibitory activity. This phenomenon produces an increase in neuronal excitability or the loss of inhibitory capacity of nerve cells.').
disease(dog, 'Ehrlichiosis', 'Ehrlichiosis is a disease caused by the Erlichia parasite, a microorganism that lives in the blood cells of different hosts. The parasite migrates from one host to another, using ticks as a vehicle. Fighting this microorganism is extremely difficult, because most antibiotics do not penetrate inside the cells. There are 3 forms of manifestation of Ehrlichiosis: acute, subclinical, chronic').
disease(dog, 'Enteritis', 'Enteritis is an inflammatory condition that manifests itself in the intestinal tract. The main clinical manifestation is diarrhea, one of the most common transit disorders of dogs. Other common symptoms of Enteritis are fever, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal pain and changes in the puppy s general condition.').
disease(dog, 'Folliculitis', 'Folliculitis in dogs is a dermatitis of a bacterial nature, one of those diseases in dogs that manifests itself especially in four-legged animals with short fur. The main characteristic of folliculitis is the appearance of "fur eaten by moths", due to the areas affected by alopecia (lack of hair, which has fallen) on the chest, dorso-lumbar area and in the ventral part of the abdomen.').
disease(dog, 'Furunculosis', 'Furunculosis in dogs is manifested by purulent inflammation of the sebaceous gland, the hair follicle and the subcutaneous tissue. The condition is caused by the staphylococcal microflora that lives on the skin.').
disease(dog, 'Glaucoma', 'Glaucoma is an extremely dangerous condition for dogs. Approximately 40% of the cases diagnosed with glaucoma lead to the definitive loss of vision in that eye within a year. The condition manifests itself through an imbalance of pressure at the level of the affected eye, determined by a dysregulation of the rhythm of the flow of fluids that normally maintain the pressure within normal parameters.').
disease(dog, 'Gastritis', 'Gastritis in dogs is a condition that manifests itself through inflammation of the mucous membrane on the surface of the stomach walls. The most common symptoms of this disease in dogs are: stomach pain, refusal to eat, reduced appetite, nausea.').
disease(dog, 'Granuloamele', 'The disease is mainly found in large dogs and is often caused by another skin condition. Lick granulomas are specific areas on the skin, mainly on the limbs, affected by itching. Due to the fact that the quadruped licks and gnaws these areas, the skin reddens, the hair falls out and open wounds appear.').
disease(dog, 'Canine herpes', 'Hepatitis is a contagious condition that affects not only humans, but also dogs. The manifestation of this disease is severe, even fatal in some cases. Hepatitis in dogs is caused by adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1), affecting especially young dogs and unvaccinated puppies. Hepatitis is on the list of dog diseases for which there is a vaccine in the mandatory dog vaccination scheme.').
disease(dog, 'Hepatitis', 'Hypothyroidism in dogs is manifested by the decrease in the secretion of thyroid hormones, caused by the inflammation or progressive insufficiency of the thyroid glands. The lack of toridian hormones has the effect of decreasing metabolic activity, which affects the metabolism of most organs in the quadruped s body.').
disease(dog, 'Hyperthyroidism', 'Unlike hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism is a condition determined, this time, by the excessive secretion of thyroid hormones. Hyperthyroidism most often affects old dogs (4-18 years), of both sexes.').
disease(dog, 'Histoplasmosis', 'Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease, from which both humans and dogs can suffer. This disease usually affects the lungs, but it can also have a generalized form. In the latter case, it can affect the lymph nodes, liver, spleen.').
disease(dog, 'Heart failure', 'Heart failure is a syndrome that manifests as a result of serious dysfunctions, manifested mainly by the inability of the cardiocirculatory system to support adequate blood circulation.').
disease(dog, 'Renal failure', 'The role of the kidneys in dogs is the same as the one they have in the case of the human body: they maintain the concentration of water and salt in the body within normal limits, they help to balance blood pressure, to metabolize calcium and to maintain the level of phosphorus, but also to produce a hormone that encourages the production of red blood cells. Also, the kidneys release certain substances into the blood, as they filter the body s waste, to be eliminated later in the form of urine. Well, kidney failure is when the kidneys don t work properly, so toxins accumulate in the dog s blood, and it gets sick.').
disease(dog, 'Jaundice', 'Jaundice in dogs is manifested by an excessive accumulation of yellow pigment in the blood and in the tissues, causing yellowing of the skin, gums and eyes. This yellow pigment is called Bilirubin, a bile pigment produced by red blood cells. Normally, Bilirubin is excreted, but its excessive accumulation in the blood can seriously affect the dog s liver, kidneys and brain tissue.').
disease(dog, 'Urinary tract infections', 'A bacterial infection of the urinary tract most often affects the dog s bladder, manifesting itself in frequent urination that is sometimes uncontrolled, but also in signs of bladder irritation.').
disease(dog, 'Leptospirosis in dogs', 'Leptospirosis is caused by infection with Leptospira, a bacterium spread worldwide through soil and water, also transmissible to humans.').
disease(dog, 'Roundworms', 'Roundworms are a distinct type of intestinal worms that can affect dogs, causing vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss and other specific symptoms. Sometimes, however, the presence of lice is asymptomatic, therefore periodic deworming of the dog is necessary.').
disease(dog, 'Rabies', 'Sarcoptic mange, also known as Scabies, is a parasitic disease, extremely contagious, produced by the parasitism of mites either on the surface or deep in the dog s skin. This parasitism produces open skin lesions, crusts, pruritus (itching) and partial or total fur loss.').
disease(dog, 'Kennel cough', 'If your dog coughs persistently and makes specific noises as if he is choking, it is likely that he suffers from kennel cough. Most often, kennel cough is caused by a bacterium called Bordetella bronchiseptica and, most of the time, it is not a serious condition, being one of those dog diseases from which most dogs can recover after treatment.').
disease(dog, 'Tumors of the eye', 'In general, old dogs can develop different formations at the level of the eyelids, represented by different types of tumors, benign or malignant, cystic formations or abscesses.').

%% cat diseases
disease(cat, 'Auricular mange', 'Ear mites are known to cause blockage of the ear canal if left untreated, and in severe cases can lead to more severe skin infections. While these parasites can have a harsh effect on cats, they are generally easy to remove.').
disease(cat, 'Bladder and kidney uroliths', 'Most cats live without knowing serious disorders of these vital processes. Others, however, experience urolithiasis, a potentially fatal condition characterized by the formation of small stones (uroliths) somewhere within this complex system. The upper urinary tract is made up of two kidneys, with a role in metabolic processes, and two thin channels (ureters), each of them coming from a kidney and having a role in the transport of urine from the kidneys to the lower urinary tract.').
disease(cat, 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Diabetes mellitus is unfortunately a condition with a significant increase among cats, especially due to the growing number of obese cats.').
disease(cat, 'Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1)', 'Feline herpesvirus is a viral, infectious-contagious disease that affects both domestic and exotic cats, having a respiratory expression with sneezing, fever, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and the presence of ulcerative keratitis. The entry gate is the respiratory mucosa (oral, nasal, conjunctival), the virus having a cytolytic effect on the epithelia, thus causing rhinitis with sneezing and sero-purulent nasal discharge. Tracheitis can also appear along with chronic sinusitis as a sequel. Panophthalmia with muco-purulent secretions and corneal ulcers is also present. Uterine infections can affect fetuses in pregnant females. Dermatitis around the nostrils may also appear.').
disease(cat, 'Feline Calicivirosis (FCV)', 'Feline calicivirosis is a respiratory viral disease, infectious-contagious, produced by an RNA virus. The condition is very common in cats, characterized by lesions of the upper respiratory tract. Ulcerations are often found on the tongue, hard palate, lips, nose and around the claws. This disease can be complicated with pneumonia or, occasionally, with arthritis.').
disease(cat, 'Difficult breathing', 'Difficult breathing in cats, or dyspnea, is a symptom rather than a specific disease. Dyspnea occurs as a result of a large number of factors, just like in humans. A cat should always have normal breathing, unless they have been through an episode of running or playing; labored or difficult breathing, often observed, especially if the cat is resting, could be a cause for concern. When cats have difficulty breathing, they may look like they are "gasping," but they may be sitting in an awkward position with their neck stretched out, as if they are trying to open their trachea on their own, or as if they are trying to cough They will also breathe rapidly and abnormally. You should contact your veterinarian if your cat is breathing hard. There are several possible causes for shortness of breath other than overexertion or playing. Dyspnea can be a symptom of a mild to moderate condition, or it could also be a symptom of a more severe condition, such as heart failure or lung tumors. These reasons may include: congestive heart failure, pulmonary disorders, chest injuries, foreign bodies, gastric fluid overload.').
disease(cat, 'Diarrhea', 'Diarrhea is defined as a soft or watery passage of excrement (faeces). It can be caused by many factors including stress, bacteria, viruses, diet, toxins, immune-mediated disorders, medications, and even conditions that are not directly related to the gastrointestinal tract such as pancreatitis, hyperthyroidism, or adrenal gland diseases.').
disease(cat, 'Urethral obstruction', 'The most serious problem of urinary function is represented by urethral obstruction (situation in which the cat s urethra is totally or partially blocked). This endangers the animal s life and represents one of the most serious consequences of ATUIF. Uroliths are only one of the causes of urethral obstruction. Another frequent cause of urinary blockage is the urethral plug. This is a soft and malleable fragment of organic matter that contains variable amounts of minerals, cells and mucus proteins.').
disease(cat, 'Urolithiasis (urinary stones)', 'Another possible cause of lower urinary tract diseases in cats (ATUIF.) is represented by urinary stones (or uroliths), which are hard mineral conglomerates that form inside the urinary tract of cats. Cats with urinary stones may exhibit many of the common symptoms of ATUIF. The treatment applicable to cats with urolithiasis depends on the mineral composition of the uroliths; however, their surgical removal is often necessary. The two most common types of uroliths that occur in cats are struvites and calcium oxalates.').
disease(cat, 'Feline idiopathic cystitis', 'Feline idiopathic cystitis (CIF), also known as interstitial cystitis, is the most common diagnosis in cats with diseases of the lower urinary tract. The diagnosis of CIF is made by exclusion, that is, the term CIF is used when no diagnostic test can confirm the presence of a certain condition, such as urinary lithiasis. Cats suffering from CIF frequently try to urinate, probably as a result of bladder discomfort, and they often have blood in the urine. Symptoms of lower urinary tract disease in cats with non-obstructive CIF often improve spontaneously after a few weeks, regardless of treatment or not. Therefore, most treatments are aimed at preventing further recurrence of symptoms.').
disease(cat, 'Skin diseases', 'Skin diseases, or dermatosis, occur relatively frequently in cats. Studies have shown that between 6-15% of feline patients show at least one dermatopathy, while many cats have several skin diseases. For example, among the cats that presented themselves at the dermatology department of the Cornell University Veterinary Hospital, a recent study demonstrated that 22% of them presented symptoms expressed by two dermatological pathological entities, and 6% suffered from three conditions distinct skin.').
disease(cat, 'Diseases of the ears', 'A wide variety of problems can cause discomfort at this level; some of these can also lead to hearing loss.').
disease(cat, 'Tumors', 'Superficial tumors are common in cats. It is often impossible to determine whether a surface tumor is benign or malignant just by its appearance. The only way is to make a diagnosis by biopsy, a procedure by which the tissues or cells are removed by the veterinarian and examined under a microscope by a veterinary pathologist.').
disease(cat, 'Fever', 'A warm, dry nose or warm ears do not indicate fever in cats. The only way to be sure of the presence of fever is to actually take the cat s temperature. The normal body temperature in cats is higher than in humans. The normal range is 38°C to 39°C.').
disease(cat, 'Cognitive dysfunction', 'As cats age, like humans, they become susceptible to various diseases associated with old age. As the years pass, the function of their internal organs depreciates more and more, and the efficiency of their immune system naturally decreases. According to the latest census figures obtained by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), there are currently approximately 82 million cats in the United States, compared to 71 million in 2001.').
disease(cat, 'Infectious anemia', 'Infectious anemia can be transmitted to any cat through fleas and ticks that have previously fed on an infected animal, but cats with weakened immune systems are at greater risk.').

% General Tips

tip(dog, 'Do not leave dangerous objects within reach.', 'Cubs are extremely curious and can easily put their lives in danger. Therefore, dangerous things such as disinfectants, insecticides and other items containing chemicals should be hidden and kept high. In this way, the risk of the animal ingesting any of these toxic compounds and having problems, as they can be fatal, will be reduced. Additionally, if you have a garden, you need to get rid of some plants that can be poisonous to your puppy.').
tip(dog, 'Do not leave him alone in dangerous places.', 'Never leave a puppy alone in places where it can get hurt, both indoors and outdoors. It can get hurt easily. Indoors, one of the most dangerous places for the animal is the bathroom. Puppies often play with the water in the toilet, a habit they will have a hard time giving up. In addition, it is also harmful if they manage to drink water from the toilet bowl.').
tip(dog, 'You must have different necessary items in your house', 'When the puppy arrives home, you should also know that the animal needs a few basic items: Collar, leash and harness to take him out for a walk; Food and water containers. Preferably metal; Brush and comb; Matching toys; Bed and sleeping space.').
tip(dog, 'Educate your puppy', 'If you manage to teach the puppy to follow a series of rules from the first months, you can avoid problems in the future. One of the most important rules is proper socialization with other dogs and people. The puppy also needs to be taught how to interact with children, just as children need to be educated on how to handle animals. Children need to know how to correctly interpret the dog s language and be able to interact with it properly.').

tip(dog, 'Be careful that your friend does not destroy your furnitur', 'Dogs can destroy garden furniture or plants when they have too much energy that they haven t used up through exercise. Another possibility is the desire to attract the attention of the owners. There is also the possibility of being bored and trying to have fun. For this reason, it is advisable to tire the dog with daily exercises or offer him toys, motivating the animal both mentally and physically. If not, these types of actions occur, to which you should never react using violence to the animal.').
tip(dog, 'You need to establish a certain routine', 'All of the above leads to the conclusion that it is good to establish a certain routine for your dog. In this way, by establishing certain activities and with which he is accustomed, he will behave correctly. These are just a few tips on how to take care of a dog in the house. The most important thing is, whenever possible, to establish a routine that allows both the animal and you to spend time together. In this way, through games or exercises, the animal will know when it is time to play and when it is time to rest. Thus, both the dog and you will be happy and enjoy a beautiful life together.').

tip(cat, 'Groom your cat regularly', 'You might be thinking, but don t cats groom themselves? While cats are known for their cleanliness, some extra help from you can take their health and hygiene to the next level! Short-haired, medium-haired and long-haired cats can all benefit from regular brushing. This helps remove loose hair from the coat, preventing shedding and hairballs. In addition to practical benefits, regular grooming can be a wonderful way to bond with your cat!').
tip(cat, 'Provide fresh water 24/7', 'Just as it is for us, drinking enough water is essential for our cats  health. Proper hydration can keep your cat comfortable and happy by helping to prevent common cat health issues like urinary tract infections and kidney disease. Many cats are picky about the water they drink. If you ve ever caught your cat sipping from the sink or pawing at her water bowl, chances are she prefers moving water. This is a common and natural preference among cats! You can give your cat the fresh, flowing water she prefers and encourage her to drink, boosting her hydration, with a pet fountain.').
tip(cat, 'Make sure your cat always has a place to potty', 'Should you have more than one litter box? Maybe! A general rule of thumb is to provide one for each cat in your home, plus one more. So, ideally, if you have two cats, you should have three litter boxes. This way, there s always an alternative available in case your cat doesn t feel like using her usual box for some reason. Speaking of which, be mindful of where you place a litter box. Make sure it s somewhere that your cat can always access, and where she ll feel comfortable letting her guard down when nature calls.').
tip(cat, 'Keep the litter box clean', 'No one likes a dirty restroom. Many cats will find another place to go (like the carpet... or your pillow) if their litter box hasn t been cleaned in a while. With a traditional litter box, you should try to scoop at least once daily and clean the entire box at least once a week. If you re not a fan of scooping poop (who is?), a self-cleaning litter box is a life-changer, saving you from the stinky chore while giving your cat the consistently clean litter box she deserves. If you do notice your cat is suddenly going outside the litter box, especially when it s clean, check with your vet – this can sometimes be a sign of medical issues.').
tip(cat, 'Train your cat to use a scratching post', 'Scratching is a natural, healthy and important behavior for cats. Unfortunately, in our homes this healthy behavior can come at a cost to our décor. Regular scratching on an appropriate surface such as carpet, sisal, or cardboard helps remove the old layers from your cat s claws. Not only will this help prevent damage to your furniture, it will help your cat stretch her muscles and keep her claws in top condition. While it may take some time to introduce your cat to a scratching post or board, it s well worth the effort. Your cat (and your couch) will thank you!').
tip(cat, 'Use a cat carrier in the car', 'Does your cat need to visit the vet? Or are you bringing her along on vacation? Always transport your cat in an appropriate carrier designed for pets. Allowing your cat to roam freely in the car can distract you from driving safely, which can lead to accidents that may harm both you and your cat.').
tip(cat, 'Maintain a healthy diet and weight', 'Just like humans, dogs, and many other animals, cats can experience health issues if they become overweight. And just like us, the keys to a healthy weight are diet and exercise. To maintain a healthy diet, talk to your vet about which food is best for your cat. If your vet recommends a dry food (kibble) diet, consider an automatic pet feeder to help maintain a consistent routine and portion control. And when it comes to exercise, cat toys are a fun way to keep your cat s mind and body active. By engaging your cat s natural predator instincts, many cat toys make your cat s inner tiger happy while also keeping her slim and trim.').
tip(cat, 'Consider spaying or neutering your cat', 'Reproductive diseases can be serious, and affect both male and female cats. Spaying prevents uterine infections and ovarian cancers, and reduces the risk of mammary tumors in female cats, while neutering prevents testicular cancer and some prostate problems in males. Neutering also reduces a male cat s urge to roam, reducing the risk of getting lost or injured away from home. And of course, spaying and neutering helps cats everywhere by reducing the number of homeless cats in shelters. In general, a fixed pet is usually a healthier, happier pet, but your vet can help you decide what is best for your cat.').
tip(cat, 'Choose a cat-friendly vet', 'Did you know there are some doctors who exclusively see feline patients? It seems to go without saying that cats are not smaller versions of dogs. That said, it follows that cats have different veterinary requirements than dogs do. A veterinarian specializing in feline health and behavior can be a valuable ally in keeping your cat healthy and happy for a lifetime. You can find a feline vet in your area by visiting the American Association of Feline Practitioners.').
tip(cat, 'Schedule regular veterinary visits', 'Even if your cat seems healthy, you should visit the vet at least once a year. Annual visits give the vet a chance to catch any potential health issues in their early stages, administer vaccines, and clean your cat s teeth. Your vet can also tell you if your cat is at a healthy weight. And of course, if your cat seems sick or you notice any changes to appetite, litter box use or activity, it s always best to consult your vet.').
